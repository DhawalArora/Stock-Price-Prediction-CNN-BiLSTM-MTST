# Stock Price Prediction using CNN-BiLSTM and MTST Models

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict stock price trends for Tesla, GE, Apple, and Nvidia using CNN-BiLSTM and MTST models. The models are trained on historical stock data and evaluated using metrics like MAPE, RMSE, and cumulative returns.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DhawalArora/Stock-Price-Prediction-CNN-BiLSTM-MTST.git# Stock-Price-Prediction-CNN-BiLSTM-MTST


Install the required libraries:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the scripts:

  - data_preprocessing.py: Preprocess the stock data.

  - model_training.py: Train the CNN-BiLSTM and MTST models.

  - evaluation.py: Evaluate the models and generate results.

Results
Figure 1: Predicted vs. Actual Stock Prices.

### **Step 6: Push to GitHub**
1. **Create a New Repository** on GitHub (as explained earlier).
2. **Upload the Files**:
   - `data_preprocessing.py`
   - `model_training.py`
   - `evaluation.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `README.md`
3. **Commit and Push** the files to GitHub.

### **Next Steps**
1. **Run the Code**: Test the scripts in Google Colab or your local environment.
2. **Generate Results**: Create graphs and tables for your report.
3. **Draft the Report**: Use the results to write your project proposal.
